# React Login Exercise

## Remember

* Don't forget to add prefixing to your production pipeline. 


## Production Build

* To get a production build run `npm run build` from the root directory. This will create and populate a folder called "build". 
* At this point the production build is transpiled, bundled and minified. It should be ready to deploy to a server as is. 


## Development

* If you have pulled this repo fresh to your machine, then you can just run `npm install` from the root directory to install all your dependencies. 

* Use `npm start` to start up the development environment. This will give you a live server with hot reload.

* This project uses Sass, so if you want to make changes to the styling, do it in `src/scss`. (The conversion from scss to css is handled by gulp.js and is already written into the `npm start` script.)
