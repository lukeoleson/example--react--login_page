# React Login Excercise

## Production Build

* To get a production build run `npm build` from the root directory. This will create and populate a folder called "build" with a bundled, minified, transpiled version of the app that is ready for deployment. 

## Development

* Use `npm start` to start up the development environment. This will give you a live server with hot reload.

* This project uses Sass, so if you want to make changes to the styling, do it in `src/scss`. (The conversion from scss to css is handled by gulp.js and is already written into the `npm start` script.)
